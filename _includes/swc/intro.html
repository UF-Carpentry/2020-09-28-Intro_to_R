  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including data management, basic R programming, data visualization, and version control.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
